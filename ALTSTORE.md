# AltStore Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install rdzSonde on your iOS device using AltStore.

## What is AltStore?

AltStore is an alternative app store for iOS that allows you to sideload apps without jailbreaking. It uses your free Apple Developer account to sign apps locally on your device.

## Prerequisites

- **iOS device** (iPhone or iPad) running iOS 12.2 or later
- **AltStore** installed on your device ([altstore.io](https://altstore.io))
- **AltServer** running on your Mac or PC
- **Same WiFi network** for your device and computer

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Add AltStore Source (Recommended)

This method allows AltStore to automatically check for and notify you of app updates.

1. Open **AltStore** on your iOS device
2. Tap the **"Browse"** tab at the bottom
3. Tap the **"+"** button in the top-right corner (Sources)
4. Enter this URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/trickv/rdz/releases/latest/download/altstore-source.json
   ```
5. Tap **"Add"**
6. Find **rdzSonde** in your new source and tap **"Install"**

### Method 2: Direct IPA Installation

1. Download the latest `.ipa` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/trickv/rdz/releases)
2. Open the downloaded file in **AltStore** on your device
   - Or use **AltServer** on your computer to sideload it
3. AltStore will sign and install the app

## Post-Installation

### Grant Permissions

When you first launch rdzSonde, iOS will prompt you to grant permissions:

- **Location Services**: Required to show your position on the map
- **Local Network**: Required to discover TTGO devices via mDNS

Tap **"Allow"** for both prompts to enable full functionality.

### Refresh Apps

AltStore-signed apps expire after 7 days (free Apple Developer account). To keep rdzSonde working:

1. Connect your device to the same WiFi as AltServer
2. Open AltStore
3. Tap **"My Apps"**
4. Pull down to refresh
5. AltStore will automatically re-sign your apps

**Tip**: Enable **"Background Refresh"** in AltStore settings to automatically refresh apps when connected to WiFi.

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to Install" Error

- Ensure AltServer is running on your computer
- Verify your device is on the same WiFi network
- Check that you've entered your Apple ID credentials in AltServer

### App Crashes on Launch

- Try reinstalling the app
- Check that all permissions were granted
- Ensure you're running iOS 12.2 or later

### Updates Not Showing

- Pull down to refresh in the AltStore Sources tab
- Remove and re-add the source URL
- Check your internet connection

## Building Your Own IPA

If you want to build rdzSonde from source:

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow the build instructions in `CLAUDE.md`
3. Create a release tag: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push --tags`
4. GitHub Actions will automatically build and publish the IPA

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) will:
- Build the iOS app
- Create an IPA package
- Generate the AltStore source JSON
- Publish both to GitHub Releases

## Technical Details

### AltStore Source Configuration

The `altstore-source.json` file contains metadata about the app:
- App name, description, and icon
- Version information and download URLs
- Required permissions
- Screenshots (if available)

This file is automatically generated during the release process and hosted on GitHub.

### iOS Capabilities

rdzSonde requires the following iOS capabilities:
- **Core Location**: GPS positioning
- **Network**: TCP connections to TTGO devices
- **Bonjour Services**: mDNS discovery (`_jsonrdz._tcp`)

These are configured in the app's `Info.plist` via Cordova's `config.xml`.
